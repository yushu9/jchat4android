# Welcome to Android jChat project! #

## Chatting on Android the agent way ##
Android jChat is a  Location Based Chat application that provides a good example of peer-to peer application aimed at proving the power of adding JADE (http://jade.tilab.com) agent capabilities to the ANDROID Platform.

JADE introduces the concept of agent oriented development and this application demonstrates the flexibility of this approach, that it is easily applied to a common p2p environment as in a chat application.

The current version of jChat is based on an old version of JADE. A new version of JADE (4.1.1) that supports Android 2.2 or above was released on November 18, 2011. More info or resources can be found [here](http://jade.tilab.com/news-art.php?id=51).
It's also possible to download [here](http://jade.tilab.com/resources/chatAndroid.zip) a simple chat application described on the [JADE programming for Android tutorial](http://jade.tilab.com/doc/tutorials/JadeAndroid-Programming-Tutorial.pdf) that uses the latest version of JADE.
A new version of jChat based on the new version of JADE will be released soon.

Please tell us if you enjoyed jChat by posting your comments in our wiki or by helping filling up our issue list.
